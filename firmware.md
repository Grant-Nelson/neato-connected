# Firmware 3.2.0 and 4.3.5
When I got the robot it had the latest firmware version `4.3.5` but while testing the serial interface I kinda accidentally reset it to factory settings. I wanted to explore the factory firmware at some stage, but this happened eariler then I tought. The factory firmware on my robot is `3.2.0`.


When I plugged in a USB-stick to the robot I had these states/error status, once the logs were copied the firmware updated.
